PureDarwin is a pure *Hardware* implementation of *CoreWar*.

Darwin:
   Darwin is the predecessor of the **CoreWar** game.

CoreWar:
   In Corewar, programs are fighting each other in the same memory
   space, the goal is to kill the other programs by making them
   execute illegal instructions.

   Programs are written in assembly, **RedCode** is the name of the
   assembly used.

Hardware:
   Our goal here is to achieve a silicon running CoreWar game engine.

.. note::

   This is not the only project pursuing this goal, you might also
   be interested in the `Memory Array Redcode Computer`_.
