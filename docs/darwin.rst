Darwin
======

From Wikipedia_:

    Darwin was a programming game invented in August 1961 by Victor
    A. Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and M. Douglas McIlroy. The game
    was developed at Bell Labs, and played on an **IBM 7090
    mainframe** there. The game was only played for a few weeks before
    Morris developed an "ultimate" program that eventually brought the
    game to an end, as no-one managed to produce anything that could
    defeat it.
