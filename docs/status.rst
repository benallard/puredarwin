A good simulation basis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I realized the incapacity of MyHDL to synthesize anything. That's not
bad in itself, Actually, I did not ordered my ALTERA yet, so, I'm not
able to check any synthesis. And better yet, till now, even If I tried
to keep to a synthetizable MyHDL, I never used it. I used MyHDL, (I
have to admit it, without realizing it), as a prototyping tool, and
thanks to it, I got results !

The current repository also has a good base for simulation, lots of
components are there, :doc:`modules/pspace` is still missing, and some
function implementation might also be missing, but a good basis is
there.

Try it if you feel you can, and don't forget to report Issues !
